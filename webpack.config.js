  // tell webpack to take .jsx file and pass them to Bable for transpiling. The way you do this is with loaders. Having devtools option as `source-map` generates the source map files which helps to debug on development. You can simple tack on more loaders as needed like the SASS loader below.
  devtool: 'source-map',
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/, //RegEx that webpack uses to determine if .js/.jsx files should be transpiled.
        loaders: ['react-hot','babel'], // Loaders to be used. Must be installed.
        exclude: /node_modules/ // exclude node modules.
      },
      {
        test: /\.scss$/,
        loaders:['style', 'css?sourceMap', 'sass?sourceMap'], // utilizing source map options for css debugging in dev tools. Displays source file for given css selector or element.
        include: path.join(__dirname)
        // To load ONLY the scss files you specify use syntax below or someting similar. Not sure what syntax should be just yet.
        // include: [
        //   path.join(__dirname, '/resources/assets/scss'),
        //   path.join(__dirname, '/public/stylesheets/scss')
        // ]
      }
